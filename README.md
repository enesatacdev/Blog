# MVC Blog Project
Blog page and panel example using MVC and Entity Framework.

The project is still under construction and has many more deficiencies. I am working on the comment system now, I will do the login and registration parts in the future, the login and registration parts will be hashed with md5 encryption, since it lacks a lot on the security side, I will focus on the security part after the main issues are over.

There is also a category adding and editing page in the panel as in the examples above.

Since it is still in beta, I will add homepage editing, slider editing, comment approval and editing pages later over time.
